2. Navigate to each page
3. Take screenshots (use Windows Snipping Tool or Win+Shift+S)
4. Save the images in this folder with the exact names listed above
5. Images should be PNG format for best quality

## Image Guidelines:

- **Format**: PNG (recommended) or JPG
- **Size**: Keep under 1MB per image for faster loading
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or similar (high enough to be clear)
- **Content**: Make sure no sensitive data is visible

## Notes:

- These images will be referenced in DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md
- The markdown already has the correct paths: `screenshots/home.png`, etc.
- Once you add the images here, they'll automatically display in the documentation
